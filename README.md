This project is a Python-based, read-only automation tool that connects remotely to Nutanix Prism using REST APIs to audit virtual machine networking. It gathers information about VM network interfaces, subnet associations, and connectivity details, then exports the data into a CSV report. The script is intended for remote administration scenarios, helping administrators quickly understand network layouts, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and maintain accurate documentation across Nutanix environments.


Python script that connects remotely to Nutanix Prism and collects VM network information. It maps virtual machines to their network interfaces and subnets, then exports the data to a CSV file. Useful for remote network audits, troubleshooting, and documentation in Nutanix environments.
